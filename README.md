# Final Project
Repository for my Final Project.

What I am looking to accomplish with my this final project is to create 3 unique auditorily interactive pieces of art. Through the use of their voice, I want users to be able to modify different aspects of each piece without having to touch anything physically. Each piece will be founded upon and incorporate the idea that our voices are powerful tools. 

The first page will see users interacting with centered multicolored overlapping 2D circles which will each alter in size(have their radius modified) through the sound analyzer functions of JavaScript in correlation to a song that will be playing. The user will be able to make adjustments to the colors of the circles using their microphone.

The second page will have users interact with a significantly less abstract drawing of a wine glass. As the decibels of the sound picked up by the user’s microphone increase, the glass will begin to shake until it shatters.

The third page will put the user in a classic scene from the film, “Back to the Future”. The photograph of Marty McFly and his siblings will begin to fade away. Using their voice, the song “Earth Angel” will play and the picture will reverse fading.
